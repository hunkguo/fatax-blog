The drama "Tian Dao" was changed from the book "The Distant Savior" written by Doudou. The plot of the TV series has been deleted several times, and it cannot fully reflect the essence of the book. Most of the friends who have read this book say that the writing is very good and very good. For those who like to speculate in stocks, many people have read this book, and many of the dialogues in this book are quite classic.

For example, Ding Yuanying said this paragraph about private equity funds: "The huge profits of stocks do not arise from production and operation, but from the speculation of the stock market itself. Its operating power is: put the money in your pocket into my pocket. Its rule is: put the meat of most sheep into the mouths of very few wolves. Private equity funds take meat from the mouths of wolves, which requires you to be darker and more ruthless than the wolf, but the cost is also higher. And there's an added layer of risk outside of the stock market."
Another example is the section of strong culture: "A strong culture is a culture that follows the law of development of things, and a weak culture is a culture that relies on the moral expectations of the strong to obtain it, that is, the culture of the savior. Strong culture is called "the secret" in martial arts. , and the disadvantaged culture has become a popular variety because it is easy to learn, understand, and use."


"The huge profits of stocks do not arise from production and operation, but from the speculative nature of the stock market itself. Its operating motive is: put the money in your pocket into my pocket. Its rule is: put most sheep the meat of which is stuffed into the mouths of very few wolves.

Private equity funds take meat out of the wolf's mouth, which requires you to be darker and more ruthless than the wolf, but the psychological cost is also higher, and there is an additional risk outside the stock market. So, stop in moderation. "

Rui Xiaodan said, "Yuanying, have you ever thought about it? If the stock doesn't earn more than double the money, your contribution to Ouyang Ding will be significantly higher, which is a pressure on her."

Ding Yuanying said: "It is possible, but this possibility is very small, and it can be remedied." Rui Xiaodan asked: "How do you know that the stock can earn more than double the money? Why must it be sold in May next year? Generally They all think that the return of Hong Kong next year and the holding of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China are all good news for the stock market."

Ding Yuanying said: "This issue is very complicated. There are many factors, such as technology, system, and industrial structure. I can't tell you.

Rui Xiaodan said: "The bookstore is full of books that teach people to trade stocks. How come you can't even talk about it."

Ding Yuanying said: "Is there really a secret to making money that people can tell you? If you can make money like that, you don't need to write a book."

Rui Xiaodan nodded: "Yes."

Ding Yuanying said: "In this context, you have to keep an eye on both the banker's black hand and the yamen's sharp knife. You have to use chopsticks when there is meat in the wolf's mouth, and you have to get out before the yamen draws the knife."
