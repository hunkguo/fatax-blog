title: Under the new income standard Settlement example of contract liability tax treatment
---
The revised "Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 14-Revenue" (hereinafter referred to as "New Revenue Standards") recognizes revenue based on contracts with customers, and further regulates revenue recognition, measurement and related information disclosure. Contract liabilities are a new concept added to the new revenue standards, reflecting the relationship between the performance of the company's performance obligations and the payment of customers. This article is based on the application case of the revenue standard issued by the Accounting Department of the Ministry of Finance on December 11, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as the "new revenue standard application case"), and analyzes the contract liabilities involved in the processing of value-added tax as follows.

The relationship between contract liability accounting and advance receipts

The new income standard is closely related to the "contract." A contract is a legally binding agreement on rights and obligations between two or more parties. In practice, it is necessary to deeply understand the connotation of the contract and effectively distinguish the rights and obligations stipulated in the contract. Contract liabilities refer to the obligation of an enterprise to transfer goods to customers at the consideration received or receivable from customers. If the company has not yet transferred the product to the customer, but the customer has paid the consideration or the company unconditionally collects the amount of the consideration, the company shall report to the customer the contractual obligation to transfer the product when the customer transfers the product. Payment or payment due Contract liability.

The accounting treatment of contract liabilities is similar to that of advance receipts. The two are similar in concept, but the contract liabilities are based on the obligations of the contract, and the advance payment does not emphasize that the contract with the customer has been established. The consideration received before the establishment of the contract cannot be regarded as a contract liability, but an advance payment. When an enterprise receives an advance payment due to the transfer of goods for accounting treatment in accordance with the new income standard, it no longer uses the "advance payment" account and the "deferred income" account.

Case: There are two application cases of the new revenue standard involving contract liability accounting. One is the sale of stored-value cards with different value-added tax rates; the other is the pre-sale of shopping cards on e-commerce platforms. In addition, in sales rewards, customer reward points, and other sales that provide customers with additional purchase options, before the points are exchanged, the transaction price corresponding to the points should be regarded as a contract liability. The following is a specific analysis of the value-added tax treatment related to contract liabilities in combination with cases.

Case 1: Selling stored-value cards with different value-added tax rates

Company A operates a supermarket chain (general taxpayer of value-added tax), and sells goods to customers as the main person in charge. Different value-added tax rates are applicable to the products sold by company A. In 2×18, Company A sold 5,000 non-refundable stored-value cards to customers, each with a face value of 200 yuan, for a total of 1 million yuan. Customers can use these stored-value for consumption in any store operated by Company A’s card. Based on historical experience, Company A expects that the number of stored-value cards purchased by customers will be consumed.

Company A should divide the money received from the sale of stored-value cards into two parts. The first part is the commodity price part, which represents the obligation of company A to transfer the goods to the customer based on the consideration received from the customer, which should be confirmed as contract liability; the second part is the value-added tax part, because it does not meet the definition of contract liability Should be recognized as contract liabilities. Pursuant to the "Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues Concerning the Administration of the Pilot Value-Added Tax Reform" (State Administration of Taxation Announcement No. 53 of 2016), VAT is not levied on the prepaid funds obtained by holders of single-purpose cards or single-purpose card holders. Since the sales of stored-value cards have not reached the time when the statutory tax liability for value-added tax occurs, the value-added tax cannot be included in the "tax payable-value-added tax payable (output tax)". For value-added tax that has not yet incurred the obligation to pay, according to the "Notice of the Ministry of Finance on Printing and Distributing the "Measures for the Administration of Value-Added Tax Accounting" (Caikuai [2016] No. 22)), the relevant output tax is included in the "tax payable-rewriteable items" "Tax" subject, then transferred to the "tax payable-value-added tax payable (output tax)" or "tax payable-simple tax calculation"" topic. Since the products sold by company A in this example have different tax rates, company A should estimate the company's comprehensive tax rate for similar businesses to estimate the situation of customers using this type of stored-value card to purchase products with different tax rates and deposit the value-added tax paid by the estimated value card Part of it is recognized as "tax payable-tax to be offset", and the remainder of the product price is recognized as contract liabilities. The comprehensive tax rate of the similar business of that company A in the previous year was 13.6%. When company A received the payment from the stored-value card, the accounting treatment was as follows (unit: yuan).

Borrow: bank deposit 1000000

    Loan: Contract liabilities 880282

    Loan: Tax payable-tax on finished products to be written off 119718

When a customer uses a stored-value card to consume, confirm the sales revenue of the product and the corresponding value-added tax output tax, and deduct the corresponding contract liability and the tax that should be offset. When there is a difference between the customer's actual consumption and the forecast, it should be adjusted according to the actual situation. On each subsequent balance sheet date, it is necessary to re-estimate the amount of contract liabilities and taxes payable based on the latest information.

Case 2: Pre-sale of shopping cards on e-commerce platforms

Company A operates an e-commerce platform (general taxpayer of value-added tax). Merchants on the platform are responsible for the purchase, pricing, delivery and after-sales service of goods. Company A only provides a platform for merchants to conduct transactions with consumers, and is responsible for assisting merchants and consumers to settle payments. Company A will charge merchants a commission based on 5% of the payment. In 2×18, Company A sold 1,000 non-refundable electronic shopping cards to consumers on the platform, each with a face value of 200 yuan, for a total of 200,000 yuan.

The "customer" in the new revenue standard refers to the party that has entered into a contract with an enterprise to purchase goods or services produced by the enterprise in its daily activities and pay the consideration. In this example, the customers of Company A are merchants who stay on the e-commerce platform. Company A provides platforms and settlement services for merchants and consumers, collects commissions, and acts as an agent for commodity transactions. Therefore, only 10,000 yuan (200,000×5%) of the 200,000 yuan collected by company A for selling electronic shopping cards will be deducted from the corresponding value-added tax, representing the customer (merchant) consideration received by A company It should be the consumer’s obligation to provide agency services as an agent to the merchant in future consumption, and it should be recognized in the contract liabilities; the remaining 190,000 yuan is the amount collected by Company A on behalf of the merchant, as other payables, will be paid to the consumer It will be paid to the corresponding merchant when you consume it in the future. When the e-commerce platform receives commissions from the pre-sale of shopping cards, its value-added tax obligations have not yet occurred, so company A should include the corresponding value-added tax part in the "tax payable-tax to be transferred".

The accounting treatment for company A to obtain the sales amount of the electronic shopping card is as follows (unit: yuan).

Borrow: Bank deposit 200,000

    Loan: Contract liabilities 9434 [10000÷(1+6%)]

    Loan: Tax payable-project tax to be written off 566 (9434×6%)

    Loan: Other payables 190000

After the consumer actually consumes with the card, when the platform transfers the payment after deducting the commission to the merchant who stays on the platform, the commission income is confirmed, the contract liability is reduced, and the output tax is paid for the realized value-the value-added tax obligation is confirmed.

Borrow: other payables 190000

Borrow: Contract liabilities 9434

Borrow: Tax payable-rewrite project tax 566

    Loan: Bank deposit 190000

    Loan: Main business income 9434

    Loan: Tax payable-Value-added tax payable (output tax) 566

Case 3. Point reward sales

Company A is a general taxpayer of value-added tax and will implement the points reward plan on October 1, 2×18. According to the plan, customers can get 1 point into Company A for every 20 yuan sp. Each point can deduct 1 yuan for the following month. As of 2×18 on October 31, customers have accumulated 200,000 yuan of consumption and can earn 10,000 points. Based on the company's operating conditions in previous years, Company A estimated the points exchange rate to be 98%. Assume that as of 2×18 on December 31, the customer has accumulated 5,600 points. Assume that the applicable value-added tax rate for the projects operated by Company A is 16%.

Company A should divide the transaction price corresponding to the points into two parts: the commodity price and the corresponding value-added tax. The product price part represents the obligation of Company A to transfer goods to the customer at the consideration that the customer has received, and the contract responsibility should be confirmed; the tax part, because it does not meet the definition of contract liability, should not be recognized as a contract liability.

Company A needs to calculate the transaction prices of the allocated commodities and points separately. The transaction price of the transferred goods is 164360 yuan [200000÷(200000+9800)×200000÷(1+16%)], and the corresponding value-added tax output tax is 26298 yuan (164360×16%); the transaction price for the distribution of points is 8053 yuan [9800÷(200000+9800)×200000÷(1+16%)], the corresponding value-added tax to be written off is 1289 yuan (8053×16%). 2×The accounts of October 2018 are processed as follows:

Borrow: Bank deposit 200,000

    Loan: Main business income 164360

    Loan: Tax payable-Value-added tax payable (output tax) 26298

    Loan: Contract liabilities 8053

    Loan: Tax payable-tax on finished products to be written off 1289

Enterprises adopt the point-reward sales model, in which customers exchange points for commodities to form a single commodity sale, which is essentially the realization of the phased transfer of commodity ownership. In December of 2×18, the income that Company A should recognize when exchanging points was 4602 yuan (5600÷9800×8053), which offset the contract liability of 4602 yuan. At the same time, the corresponding output tax that should be written off is transferred out, and the value-added tax output tax is confirmed to be 736 yuan (5600÷9800×1289). The accounting treatment is as follows:

Borrow: contract liabilities 4602

Borrowing: Taxes payable-Taxes on output products 736

    Loan: Main business income 4602

    Loan: Tax payable-Value-added tax payable (output tax) 736

The listed contract liabilities on the 2×18 balance sheet date were 3451 yuan (8053-4602).
