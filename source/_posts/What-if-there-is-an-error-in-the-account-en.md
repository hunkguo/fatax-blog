2. Mr. Li reimbursed 10,000 yuan for road expenses and miscalculated 20,000 yuan
3. Mr. Li called to repay the loan of 5,000 yuan, but he did not fill in the expenditure voucher and did not record it in the account
4. The cashier takes 2,000 yuan in cash for personal use
In January and May, the cash income was 10,000 yuan, but the invoice was not issued, and the cash and income were not recorded for tax reduction.

4. The cashier takes 2,000 yuan in cash for personal use

Book inventory cash=15000+10000+10000-5000=30000 (yuan)
Cashier's journal=35000-5000=30000 (yuan)
Actual inventory=28000+2000=30000 (yuan)
Example 2: At the end of May 2020, a trading company's book inventory cash balance was 15,000 yuan, and there was no cashier's journal, and the actual inventory cash was 28,000 yuan.
