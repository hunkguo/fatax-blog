The Relationship Between Contract Liability Accounting and Advance Receipts

The new revenue standard is closely related to "contracts". A contract is an agreement between two or more parties with legally binding rights and obligations. In practice, it is necessary to deeply understand the connotation of the contract and effectively distinguish the rights and obligations stipulated in the contract. A contract liability is an obligation of a business to transfer goods to a customer after receiving or receivable consideration from the customer. If the enterprise has not yet transferred the goods to the customer, but the customer has paid the consideration or the enterprise has the right to receive the consideration unconditionally, the enterprise shall transfer the goods to the customer at the time agreed in the contract. Customer payments or payments are due as contractual obligations.

The accounting of contract liabilities is similar to accounts received in advance, and the two have similarities in concept, but contract liabilities are based on contractual obligations, while accounts received in advance do not emphasize that the contract with the customer has been established. Consideration received before the formation of the contract cannot be regarded as a contract liability, but as an advance payment. When the advance receipts received by the enterprise due to the transfer of goods are subject to the new income standards for accounting treatment, the "advance receipts" and "deferred income" accounts are no longer used.

Cases: There are two cases in which the application of the new revenue standard involves the accounting treatment of contract liabilities. One is the sale of stored-value cards involving different VAT rates; the other is the pre-sale of shopping cards on e-commerce platforms. In addition, in sales that provide customers with additional purchase options, such as sales incentives, customer reward points, etc., before the points are redeemed, the transaction price corresponding to the points should be regarded as a contractual liability. The following is a detailed analysis of the VAT treatment related to contract liabilities based on a case.

Case 1. Sales of stored-value cards with different VAT rates

Company A operates a chain of supermarkets (general taxpayer of value-added tax) and sells goods to customers as the main person in charge. The goods sold by Company A are subject to different VAT rates. In 2×18, Company A sold 5,000 non-refundable stored-value cards to customers, each with a face value of 200 yuan, totaling 1 million yuan. Customers can use such stored-value cards to make purchases at any store operated by Company A. According to historical experience, Company A expects that the amount of stored-value cards purchased by customers will be fully consumed.

Company A should divide the money received from the sale of stored value cards into two parts. One is the commodity price part, which represents the obligation of Company A to transfer the commodity to the customer after receiving the consideration from the customer, which should be recognized as a contract liability; The definition of a liability should not be recognised as a contract liability. According to the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues Concerning the Administration of the Pilot Program of Replacing Business Tax with Value-Added Tax (State Administration of Taxation Announcement No. 53 [2016]), single-purpose card issuers or card sellers sell single-purpose cards, or accept cardholders of single-purpose cards Prepaid funds obtained by recharging are exempt from VAT. Since the sales of stored-value cards have not yet reached the statutory tax liability of value-added tax, the value-added tax cannot be included in the "tax payable - value-added tax payable (output tax)". For the value-added tax that has not yet incurred the obligation to pay value-added tax and needs to be recognized as output tax in the future period, according to the "Notice f Ministry of Finance on Printing and Distributing the "Regulations on the Accounting Treatment of Value-Added Tax" (Cai Kuai [2016] No. 22), the relevant output tax is calculated. Enter the "tax payable - output tax" subject to be transferred", and transfer to "tax payable - value added tax (output tax)" or "tax payable" when the tax liability actually occurs. Taxes - simple Tax" subject. Since Company A in this example sells commodities with different tax rates, Company A should make estimates based on the customers' use of such stored-value cards to purchase commodities with different tax rates. The company's comprehensive tax rate for similar businesses in previous years, and the estimated stored value is calculated. The VAT paid by the card is recognized as "tax payable - output tax to be transferred", and the rest is recognized as commodity prices as contract liabilities. Assume that company A has similar business in previous years. The comprehensive tax rate is 13.6%. When Company A receives payment from a stored value card, the accounting treatment is as follows (unit: yuan).

Borrow: 1,000,000 bank deposits

Loans: Contract Liabilities 880282

Credit: Tax payable - output tax to be transferred 119718

When a customer uses a stored-value card for consumption, the sales revenue and the corresponding value-added tax output tax are confirmed, and the corresponding contract liabilities and the output tax that should be transferred out are offset. When the actual consumption situation of the customer is different from the expectation, it will be adjusted according to the actual situation. At each subsequent balance sheet date, the contract liabilities and tax payable amounts need to be re-estimated based on the latest information.

Case 2. Pre-sale shopping cards on e-commerce platforms

Company A operates an e-commerce platform (general taxpayer of value-added tax), and the platform merchants are responsible for the procurement, pricing, delivery and after-sales service of goods. Company A only provides a platform for merchants to conduct transactions with consumers, and is responsible for assisting merchants and consumers. In order to settle the payment, Company A will charge the merchant a 5% commission on the payment. On 2×18, Company A sold 1,000 non-refundable electronic shopping cards to consumers on the platform, each with a face value of 200 yuan, totaling 200,000 yuan.

The term “customer” as mentioned in the new revenue standard refers to the party who signs a contract with the enterprise to purchase goods or services from the enterprise’s daily activities and pay the consideration. In this example, Company A's customer is a merchant who stays on the e-commerce platform. Company A provides platform and settlement services for merchants and consumers, collects commissions, and acts as an agent for commodity transactions. Therefore, from the RMB 200,000 collected by Company A for selling electronic shopping cards, only the corresponding commission of RMB 10,000 (200,000 × 5%) of the value-added tax shall be deducted. The obligation of providing agency services as an agent to the merchant in the future consumer consumption shall confirm the contractual responsibility; the remaining 190,000 yuan is the money collected by A company on behalf of the merchant, as other payables, and paid to the corresponding consumer when the consumer consumes in the future. merchant. .When the e-commerce platform pre-sells the shopping card to get commission, its VAT obligation has not yet occurred, so Company A should include the corresponding VAT in the "tax payable - output tax to be transferred"".

Company A's accounting for the sales of electronic shopping cards is as follows (unit: yuan).

Borrowing: 200,000 bank deposits
Loans: contract liabilities 9434[10000÷(1+6%)]
Credit: Tax payable - output tax to be transferred 566 (9434×6%)
Credit: other payables 190000

After the consumer actually swipes the card for consumption, the platform transfers the money after deducting the commission to the merchants on the platform, confirms the commission income, offsets the contract liabilities, and realizes the output tax of the value-added tax obligation is confirmed at the same time.

Loans: other payables 190000
Debit: contract liabilities 9434
Debit: Tax payable - output tax to be transferred 566
Loans: 190,000 in bank deposits
Loans: Main business income 9434
Credit: Tax payable - VAT payable (output tax) 566

Case 3. Points Reward Sales

Company A is a general taxpayer of value-added tax, and will implement the reward points program from October 1, 2×18. According to the plan, customers can get 1 point for every 20 yuan spent in company A, and each point can deduct 1 yuan from nex
