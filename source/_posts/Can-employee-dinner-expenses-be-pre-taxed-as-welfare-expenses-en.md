What is a welfare fee?

1. Accounting

The "Notice of the Ministry of Finance on Strengthening the Financial Management of Employee Welfare Expenses for Enterprises" (Caiqi [2009] No. 242) is defined as follows: Enterprise employee benefits refer to the wages, bonuses, allowances, and total wages of employees. Management subsidies, employee education funds, social insurance premiums and supplementary endowment insurance premiums (annuities), supplementary medical insurance premiums and welfare treatment other than housing provident funds, including the following cash subsidies and non-monetary payments to or for employees Sexual collective welfare.

Article 6 of the "Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 9-Employee Compensation" (2014) stipulates that employee welfare expenses incurred by an enterprise shall be included in the current profit and loss or the cost of related assets based on the actual amount incurred. When it actually happens. If employee welfare expenses are non-monetary benefits, they shall be measured at fair value.

2. Taxation

The Corporate Income Tax Law and its implementing regulations do not clearly define employee welfare fees. However, the "Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Deduction of Enterprise Wages and Salaries and Employee Welfare Fees" (Guo Shui Han (2009) No. 3) actively enumerates its support scope:

(1) The equipment, facilities and personnel expenses incurred by the welfare department in the internal welfare department of enterprises that do not implement separate social functions, including the equipment, facilities and personnel of collective welfare departments such as staff canteens, staff toilets, hairdressing rooms, clinics, and nurseries , Nursing homes and other facilities and maintenance costs, as well as the salaries, social insurance premiums, housing provident fund, labor services, etc. of the staff in the welfare department.

(2) Various subsidies and non-monetary benefits provided for employees' medical care, living, housing, transportation, etc., including non-monetary medical expenses paid by the company to employees, and non-monetary medical expenses of company employees. Implement medical pooling and employee direct supply system. Family medical subsidies, heating subsidies, employee heatstroke prevention and cooling expenses, employee difficulties subsidies, relief expenses, employee canteen funding subsidies, employee transportation subsidies, etc.

(3) Other employee welfare expenses incurred in accordance with regulations, including funeral subsidies, pensions, resettlement expenses, travel expenses for family visits, etc.

From the aforementioned National Water Letter (2009) No. 3 list, it is true that words such as "staff dinner" cannot be found.

Similarly, if a company distributes moon cakes and rice dumplings to employees, Guo Shui Han (2009) No. 3 will not find it!

Can't these be deducted before tax?

Mistake! ! !

Why does the company give gifts to employees? Why invite employees to dinner? Why do companies hold annual meetings at the end of the year and invite everyone to have a good meal?

The purpose of this is to increase the enthusiasm of employees! Or as stated in Caiqi (2009) No. 242 and "Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 9-Employee Compensation", this is the remuneration to employees!

The provisions of the Personal Income Tax Law are even more straightforward. The rice dumplings and moon cakes allocated to employees must be directly included in wages and salaries, and individual income tax shall be withheld and paid in accordance with the "income from wages and salaries".

Since it is compensation to employees, it has to do with income.

Article 8 of the "Enterprise Income Tax Law" The actual reasonable expenses related to the income obtained by the enterprise, including costs, expenses, taxes, losses and other expenses, are allowed to be deducted when calculating the taxable income.

Regarding the provisions of the tax law, we must not be "blind"! There is a lot of "waiting" in the National Water Letter (2009) No. 3. Does the person who wrote the document know the meaning of this word? ——People should know that there are many things in real life that cannot be listed one by one, and it is impossible to list them one by one.

According to the principle of “no prohibition by law”, if the tax law does not clearly stipulate “no”, it should be understood from the perspective of benefiting taxpayers.

Therefore, employee gatherings and presenting gifts to employees (such as rice dumplings, moon cakes, etc.) can be deducted before tax, but they need to be deducted in accordance with the tax law. Welfare fees are subject to a 14% interest rate limit.

In practice, employee gatherings and presenting gifts to employees (such as rice dumplings, moon cakes, etc.) are also deducted "our fare" before tax.
