My friend recently changed jobs. When the old and new accountants were handed over, a friend found that the new company had tens of millions of inventory, but the actual warehouse did not seem to have that many. The noncommittal attitude made my friend suspicious, and he began to wonder if he could take the job. . .

In fact, there can be many reasons for inventory inaccuracy. Accepting false invoices is only a possibility, not necessarily a cause. Even a company's inventory is very different from the ledger. This could be a combination of reasons. result.
Today, we will summarize the 8 reasons for inaccurate inventory and related fiscal and tax treatment suggestions. Welcome to discuss together!
1. Damage caused by poor management
For example, the warehouse administrator of a company forgot to lock the door when he left the warehouse, which resulted in the theft of some goods.
1.1 Accounting treatment
First include property damage and spills to be dealt with. After the cause is identified, the inventory shortage caused by poor management shall be deducted from the value of the remaining materials, recoverable insurance compensation and negligence compensation, and the net loss shall be included in the management expenses.
1.2 Tax treatment
1.2.1 VAT
According to Caishui [2016] No. 36, the theft, loss, mildew and deterioration of goods caused by poor management are abnormal losses, and the input tax shall not be deducted from the output tax. Therefore, the input tax needs to be transferred out.
1.2.2 Corporate income tax
According to the provisions of the "Enterprise Income Tax Law", the reasonable expenses, including losses, actually incurred by an enterprise for the income obtained are allowed to be deducted when calculating the taxable income.
According to the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Retaining Information on Enterprise Income Tax Asset Loss for Reference (State Administration of Taxation Announcement No. 15 [2018]), enterprises only need to fill in the annual enterprise income tax asset loss information. The income tax return form "Pre-tax Deduction and Tax Adjustment Form for Asset Loss" will no longer submit relevant information on asset losses. The relevant information shall be retained by the enterprise for future reference.
2. Damage caused by natural disasters
For example: Recently, due to continuous heavy rain, a certain area was flooded, and some of the company's goods were washed away by the flood and could not be recovered.
2.1 Accounting treatment
The property loss to be dealt with is listed first. After approval, the inventory loss due to natural disasters should be deducted from disposal income (such as the value of residual materials), insurance money and possible recoverable compensation, and the net loss should be included in the business external expenditure.
2.2 Tax treatment
2.2.1 VAT
Abnormal losses refer to the theft, loss, mildew and deterioration of goods due to poor management, and the confiscation, destruction or dismantling of goods or real estate due to violation of laws and regulations.
Inventory losses caused by natural disasters are not abnormal losses of value-added tax, and the deducted input tax does not need to be transferred out.
2.2.2 Corporate income tax
Same as 1. Inventory losses caused by natural disasters can be deducted before corporate income tax, and relevant materials shall be retained by the enterprise for future reference.
3. Purchase of products and materials for real estate, collective welfare, personal consumption
For example, a supermarket distributes a portion of its purchases of microwaves sold to employees as employee benefits and uses purchased central air conditioners to build new office buildings.
3.1 Accounting treatment
For real estate construction, the inventory commodities (or raw materials) shall be transferred to the construction-in-progress;
For collective benefits or personal consumption, related costs (such as production costs or overhead) are transferred out of inventory commodities (or raw materials) and carried forward through employee compensation payable.
3.2 Tax treatment
3.2.1 VAT
A. For real estate
If the purchased materials are used for self-built real estate, the input tax should be transferred out before the value-added tax reform. After the business tax is replaced by value-added tax, it is necessary to distinguish the specific use of real estate. For details, please refer to Article 27 of Annex 1 of Caishui [2016] No. 36:
Input tax on the following items shall not be deducted from output tax:
Purchase of goods, processing, repair and replacement services, labor services, intangible assets, and real estate are used for taxable items calculated according to the simple tax calculation method, items exempted from value-added tax, collective welfare or personal consumption. Fixed assets, the intangible assets and real estate involved only refer to fixed assets, intangible assets (excluding other equity intangible assets) and real estate used for the above-mentioned projects.
Therefore, if the real estate constructed by the enterprise is an office building, the input tax of the raw materials purchased by the enterprise is allowed to be deducted from the output tax;
If the real estate constructed by the enterprise is a staff dormitory, the input tax of the raw materials used shall not be deducted from the output tax and transferred out;
If the real estate constructed by the enterprise includes office area and canteen area (not dedicated to employee benefits, etc.), the input tax of the raw materials used can still be deducted from the output tax, and there is no need to transfer it out.
B. Collective welfare, personal consumption
Still in accordance with the provisions of Article 27 of Annex 1 of Caishui [2016] No. 36, if the products and materials purchased from outside are used for collective welfare and personal consumption, the input tax shall not be deducted from the output tax, and the input tax shall be transferred out. .
Among them, taxpayers' social entertainment consumption belongs to personal consumption.
3.2.2 Corporate income tax
Income tax deemed sales and VAT deemed sales are different concepts and should not be confused. Deemed sales tax depends on whether ownership of the asset has passed.
A. For real estate
Does not change the ownership of the asset and does not need to be considered a sale for corporate income tax purposes.
B. Collective welfare, personal consumption
If the ownership of the assets changes, the revenue shall be recognized as sales according to the regulations.
4. Non-VAT taxable items, collective welfare, self-produced products for personal consumption
For example, a company that manufactures air conditioners installs its air conditioner products in new office buildings and distributes another portion of the air conditioners to employees as a benefit.
4.1 Accounting treatment
Conformity 3: If it is used for real estate construction, it shall be transferred from inventory commodities (or raw materials) to the construction-in-progress;
For collective benefits or personal consumption, related costs (such as production costs or overhead) are transferred out of inventory commodities (or raw materials) and carried forward through employee compensation payable.
4.2 Tax treatment
4.2.1 VAT
Non-VAT taxable items refer to the provision of non-VAT taxable labor services, transfer of intangible assets, sale of real estate and real estate under construction. Since May 1, 2016, my country has fully implemented the replacement of business tax with value-added tax, and all the above non-VAT taxable items have been changed to value-added tax taxable items, and there are no non-VAT taxable items anymore. However, there are simple tax calculation methods and items exempt from VAT.
Therefore, before business tax is replaced by value-added tax, if self-produced products are used for non-value-added tax taxable items, collective welfare or personal consumption, value-added tax should be regarded as sales. After the business tax is changed to VAT, since there are no non-VAT taxable items, only self-produced products used for collective welfare or personal consumption need to be sold; those used for self-built real estate are not considered sales.
4.2.2 Corporate income tax
Consistent with 3:
A. For real estate
Does not change the ownership of the asset and does not need to be considered a sale for corporate income tax purposes.
B. Collective welfare, personal consumption
If there is a change in the ownership of the assets, it shall be regarded as sales and confirmed income according to the regulations.
5. Pay off debt
Example: Company A owes Company B an unpaid account payable. After negotiation between the two parties, it was agreed to donate 100 machines and equipment produced by Company A to Company B to repay the debt.
5.1 Accounting treatment
In accounting, repayment of debts with goods is an act of debt restructuring. According to the revised "Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 12 - Debt Restructuring", as a debtor, if the debt is repaid with assets for debt restructuring, the recognition of relevant assets and debts to be repaid shall be terminated. The conditions for termination of confirmation are met. The difference between the book value of the debt and the book value of the transferred assets is included in the current profit and loss (other income - debt restructuring income).
Repayment of debt with goods does not require the recognition of main business income.
5.2 Tax treatment
5.2.1 VAT
Repayment of debts with goods does not belong to the scope of recognition
6.2 Tax treatment
6.2.1 VAT
According to the detailed rules for the implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Value-Added Tax, self-produced, entrusted processing or purchased goods, provided as investment to other units or individual industrial and commercial households, shall be regarded as sales. There is no need to distinguish whether it is self-produced inventory or outsourcing.
6.2.2 Corporate income tax
In general, in accordance with the "Notice on Income Tax Issues Concerning the Disposal of Assets by Enterprises" (Guo Shui Han [2008] No. 828) and the "Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Relevant Issues "Enterprise Income Tax" (State Administration of Taxation Announcement [2016] No. 80) If the assets are used for external investment, the income shall be recognized as sales revenue. Unless otherwise specified, the sales revenue shall be determined according to the fair value of the transferred assets.
Under special circumstances, according to the "Notice of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation on Printing and Distributing the Income Tax Policies for Non-monetary Asset Investment Enterprises" (Cai Shui [2014] No. 116), non-monetary assets obtained by resident enterprises investing in non-monetary assets abroad are The transfer income can be included in the taxable income of the current year in installments within a period of not more than 5 years, and the enterprise income tax shall be calculated and paid in accordance with the following provisions. regulations.
7. It has been sold, but has not been invoiced, revenue has not been calculated, and costs cannot be carried forward
For example, if a company sells its inventory to an individual, the other party does not need a VAT invoice. The company believes that it can pay less tax by not invoicing, and specially gives the other party a 5% discount. In the case of not recognizing income, costs cannot be carried forward casually.
7.1 Accounting treatment
According to Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 14, an enterprise should recognize revenue when the customer obtains control over the relevant commodity. At the same time, the cost of goods sold is carried forward. In addition, according to the principle of accrual basis, the enterprise needs to correct the errors of the previous period, and the enterprise should use the retrospective restatement method to correct the major errors of the previous period, except that the cumulative determination is not feasible. The effect of earlier errors.
7.2 Tax treatment
7.2.1 VAT
Many companies are still stuck in the misunderstanding of "paying taxes only when invoices are issued, and not paying taxes without issuing invoices". In fact, the timing of the occurrence of VAT liability is based on the following three timing priority principles:
① The date of receipt of the sales payment
② The date of obtaining the receipt for the sales payment
③ On the day when the invoice is issued
Remind everyone again:
Columns 5-6 of Schedule 1 of the VAT return are dedicated to the case of undocumented sales activities.

7.2.2 Corporate income tax
This is no different from a normal sale. Recognize revenue, carry forward costs, and pay tax on adjusted profits (taxable income).
Note: Corporate income tax also adopts the accrual basis. Therefore, in theory, if the company has made corrections to the financial statements of the previous years, it should also make corresponding corrections and declarations in the annual report on the settlement of corporate income tax for the previous years (generally no more than 5 years). But in practice, few businesses do this, and most of them directly adjust current tax returns. After all, there are too many reports involved in the annual report, and there is still a relationship between the reports, which affects the whole body. Therefore, for the adjustment of statements with small amount and little impact, the company will basically handle it directly in the current period, and the tax bureau generally adopts this method by default.
8. In order to deduct the input, falsely issued special invoices are accepted
For example, in a certain month, company A's sales are much greater than its investment. In order to pay less value-added tax, a special invoice for input tax of 200,000 yuan was falsely issued by the intermediary before the end of the month. In order to achieve the purpose of deducting input tax, the invoice will inevitably increase the inventory on the company's book, which is still "inventory" that cannot be sold.
8.1 Accounting treatment
Accepting falsely issued special invoices in order to pay less value-added tax should be within the scope of taxation, but not within the scope of the Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises. However, due to the inflated inv bookkeeping, it is also one of the means of financial fraud, that is, "financial fraud".
If the acceptance of false special notes occurs in the current period, the accountant can directly record it in the current inventory;
If the falsely issued special ticket was accepted in the previous year, the previous error correction shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the above 7.
According to Accounting Standard for Business Enterprises No. 28, early errors usually include negligence or misrepresentation of facts and the effect of fraud.
8.2 Tax treatment
8.2.1 VAT
Enterprises have a strong awareness of tax risks and basically do not accept fake invoices; if they are afraid of regret after accepting them, they can contact the other party to issue a red-letter invoice and handle it as "return". That way, no state tax is lost.
If the enterprise feels that accepting the false opening is for "tax avoidance" and is unwilling to take the initiative to deal with it, it is a fluke. When the tax authorities come to the door, they can only obey the arrangements of the tax authorities. Process documents to pay taxes and pay late penalties. Pay late fees.
8.2.2 Corporate income tax
Although the purpose of accepting falsely issued special invoices is to deduct the input tax, because the urban maintenance and construction tax, education surcharge, and local education surcharge are based on the actual value-added tax paid, it will inevitably lead to the underpayment of various taxes and fees for these three items. , thereby indirectly paying less corporate income tax.
The processing principle is the same as the above-mentioned value-added tax. You can make it up yourself, or you can wait for the tax authority to come to your door to make it up, plus late payment fees and fines. If the false payment amount is large and the nature is vile, which constitutes a crime, criminal responsibility shall be borne.
According to the "Administrative Measures of the People's Republic of China on Invoices", asking others to issue invoices that are inconsistent with the actual business situation is a false invoicing; , omitting or underreporting income, refusing to report, or falsely reporting tax is tax evasion. Declaration after being notified by the tax authority to declare, make up or underpay the tax due. If a taxpayer evades tax, the tax authority shall recover the unpaid or underpaid tax and overdue fines, and impose a fine of more than 50% but less than 5 times the unpaid or underpaid tax; if a crime is constituted, criminal responsibility shall be investigated according to law.
Enterprises cannot think that only false invoicing for others is false invoicing, and letting others false invoicing for themselves is false invoicing, so the act of underpaying tax is tax evasion.
The fourth phase of the Golden Tax is coming, and more corporate data will be captured by the tax bureau; it is said that "after the fourth phase of the Golden Tax is launched, the corporate inventory will be further transparent. You may know more than you how much stock there is. If the inventory accounts are inconsistent, the company must Pay attention and find out the cause in time.”
If the first six reasons discussed in this article are due to the limited business ability of corporate financial personnel, the deficiencies in the internal control system of the enterprise, and the lack of internal communication within the enterprise, then the latter two reasons are very different from the first six reasons in nature. Here, the editor still wants to advise everyone: legal operation is the long-term way of enterprise development.
